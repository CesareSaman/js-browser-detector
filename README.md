JS Browser Detector
==================================================

During my front-end career I always faced cases that I NEED to know which browser the client uses. I know there is a big trend going on about feature detection rather than browser detection, but I provided a super simple pure JS library to detect only browser (no versions detection included)

The library adds a class into body tag of HTML document containing browser name.

How to install
--------------------------------------

Just add the detector.js file in the head of your HTML document like this: (Don't forget to change URL depending on where you copy the detector.js file on your server)

<script src="detector.js"></script>
